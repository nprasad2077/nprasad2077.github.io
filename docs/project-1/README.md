### Remaining Challenges

* In future updates, I would like to add functionality to modify the number of cards being displayed to the user. This helps to create a difficulty scale by increasing or decreasing the number of cards on screen to match.
* I would like to create a theme switch so that the assets on the cards can be swapped out.
* A leaderboard/scoreboard could be implemented to track times or turns taken to win the game. (database required)
* A celebration animation once the user completes a game.
